## ‚öôÔ∏è Installing Dependencies

To install the necessary dependencies for the project to work, you need to have Python 3 installed on your machine.
After the installation, you can go to the project's root directory and execute the following command:
  - `pip install ./requirements.txt`

This will download the following dependencies:
  - ```
    beautifulsoup4==4.12.2
    requests==2.25.1
    ```

## üöÄ Executable

If you only want to run the code on your computer, you can skip the previous step (Installing Dependencies).
Once you have downloaded the files, it is important to store the root folder somewhere on your machine. Then, you can use the shortcut located in the main folder:
  - `ESPORTS Webscraping`
  - <img width="50" alt="App" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dnowdd/ESPORTS-Webscraping/main/assets/prints/icon.png">
And that's it, everything should work perfectly!

<b>NOTE: The executable only works on Windows systems!</b>

## ü§î How It Works

ESPORTS Webscraping is a project that consists of a Python application with a graphical interface developed using the Tkinter library. The main objective of the project is to obtain up-to-date information about eSports championship games, such as League of Legends (LoL), Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CSGO), Counter-Strike 2 (CS 2), Free Fire, Valorant, and more, from the [Mais Esports](https://maisesports.com.br) website.

The application uses webscraping technique, employing the BeautifulSoup library, to perform data extraction and analysis from the relevant web pages. Through the process of webscraping, ESPORTS Webscraping is able to collect detailed information about games from past championships and also about upcoming matches.

Once the data is obtained, the application displays the information in an organized and user-friendly manner, allowing users to easily track game results as well as future matches.
